OWLQN
=====
#Introduce
OWLQN is an optimization algorithm,which is called L1-LBFGS.
OWLQN algorithm is proposed by paper "Orthant-Wise Limited-memory Quasi-Newton Optimizer for L1-regularized Objectives".

This paper has provided a c++ source code running Windows.you can downlaod it at http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/b1eb1016-1738-4bd5-83a9-370c9d498a03/
Most of my go code refer to c++ source code,but I think there is some bug I fixed in go code.
